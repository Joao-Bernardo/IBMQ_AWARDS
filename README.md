## Description

Welcome to the 'Quantic Tetris!' This is a almost normal Tetris game, the only different is that it is based on some quantum mechanics properties like  'superposition', 'wave function colapse', 'entanglement' and 'mixed states'. If you want to master this game you will need to apply some quantum logic gates like 'X', 'Hadamard', 'Z' and 'CNOT' to manipulate your state and score a lot of points!

## Controls
### Movement
left arrow - move the stone to the left

right arrow - move the stone to the right
down arrow - make the stone fall faster
up arrow - rotate the stone 

### Logic Gate Application
q - toggle 'H' gate
w - toggle 'X' gate
e - toggle 'Z' gate
r - toggle 'CNOT' gate

1 - toggle 'qubit 1' as the one in wich the gate will be applied (if the gate is CNOT, it chooses 'qubit 1' as the control)
2 - toggle 'qubit 2' as the one in wich the gate will be applied (if the gate is CNOT, it chooses 'qubit 2' as the control)

enter - apply the gate
