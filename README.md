## Description

Welcome to the **QUANTIC TETRIS!** This is an almost normal Tetris game, but with a small difference that it is based on quantum mechanics properties like  **superposition**, **wave function colapse**, **entanglement** and **mixed states**. If you want to master this game you will need to apply some quantum logic gates like **X**, **Hadamard**, **Z** and **CNOT** to manipulate your state and score a lot of points!

## Controls
### Movement
left arrow - move the stone to the left

right arrow - move the stone to the right

down arrow - make the stone fall faster

up arrow - rotate the stone 

### Logic Gate Application
enter - apply toggled gate

q - toggle **H** gate

w - toggle **X** gate

e - toggle **Z** gate

r - toggle **CNOT** gate

1 - toggle **qubit 1** as the one in wich the gate will be applied (if the gate is CNOT, it chooses **qubit 1** as the control)

2 - toggle **qubit 2** as the one in wich the gate will be applied (if the gate is CNOT, it chooses **qubit 2** as the control)
